#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project contains one R script (run_analysis.R), which will calculate mans per activity and per subject of the mean and the standard deviation of the HAR Dataset from Samsung Smartphones. 

This dataset should be downloaded and unzipped directly into the data directory.
The data will be stored in a directory "UCI HAR Dataset".

The output of the script is a tidy dataset called "tidy_mean_data.txt"

More details on the dataset can be found in the CookBook.md
